# 🦉2ndrive
Bash script for auto/manual ejecting second drive on a Mac OS' boot.

It helps you to decrease noise level of a computer and save battery power. 

Typical usage of it assumes that some MacBook has both SDD and HDD and you do not want to use HDD constantly. Of course it may be helpful in some other cases.

## Steps
1. Open Terminal, run `sh 2nd.sh`. 
2. From the shown list please enter a number of the disk that you want to disable automatically. 
3. Re-run your Terminal to use new `2ndon` and `2ndoff` commands and restart your Mac to see how it works on a boot.

## Using
- Your selected drive will be automatically turned off each time Mac OS is loaded.
- Run `2ndon` in the Terminal to enable the disk
- Run `2ndoff` in the Terminal to disable the disk

Enjoy!
